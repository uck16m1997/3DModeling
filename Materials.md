# Materials

## Interaction
- Shading View is used for working with shader graphs on our models for creating materials for our objects
- For a simpler interaction with the end shader we can use the Material Properties on the right bottom Properties window

## Properties
- Metallic property changes the reflective properties of the Material
- Roughness proprety is correlated with decrease in the reflectiveness of the Material
