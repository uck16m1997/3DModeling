# Objects

## General
- Objects are are added where the 3D Cursor is located
- 3D Cursor can be moved with shift right click
- Shift A could be used for shortcut of add menu
- T is used to bring object toolbar 
- G is used to grab and move using X,Y,Z object could be locked on a axis, we can enter number for moving distance
- R is used to rotate the object using X,Y,Z object could be locked on a axis, we can enter number for rotation degrees
- S is used to scale the object using X,Y,Z object could be locked on a axis, we can enter number for scaling size
- When applying transformations holding shift enables to apply transform in smaller magnitude
- When applying transformations shift axis selection will select all the axis except given
- Left click is used to apply the transformations and Right click to canceling transformations
- In the Objects menu on the right colored objects (orange & yellow are selected) yellow is the object of focus
- N is used to bring Item, Tool & View menus on the right
- Shift D to duplicate objects and Alt D creates linked duplicates which mimics the editing
- Ctrl L is used to link different objects
- Ctrl Box Select to Deselect objects
- M is used to move selected objects in to collections
- F2 is used to rename objects
- Top magnet can be enabled to snap objects to axis or faces
- When scaling multiple objects we can use transform pivot point menu and change it to individual origins instead of the median of the objects
- Ctrl A is used to apply scale,rotation,location changes
- Ctrl J is used to join two objects together

## Context Menu
- Right Click Shade Smooth can be used to create soft edges look without changing the geometry of the object
- On the object data properties we can enable auto smooth and specify the degrees of difference for smoothing
- We can unlink two objects from Object Relations


## Editing
- Edit modes enable us to change the actual shape of our objects.
- Tab to quick change back in to previous mode.
- Vertices, Edges and Faces are how objects are broken down in edit mode
- E is used to Extrude the focused and create new components
- Ctrl R is used to create loop cuts and gives you option to move the cut along after the initial click
- If we add a mesh in edit mode it will be part of the focused object
- In edit mode we can use P to seperate two object by Loose Parts
- I is used for insetting (extrude and scaling) 
- Alt LClick can be used to loop select
- O can be used to enable proportional editing
- We can use Ctrl + to grow and Ctrl - to shrink the selected by adding or removing adjacent selections
- Ctrl B is used to Bevel the edges
- Alt E can be used to create extrusion on specific axis like extruding on normals
- When beveling vertices with Ctrl B there will be need to press V for changing the bevel mode from edge to vertex otherwise Ctrl Shift B can be used to just do vertex beveling
- J key is used to join two vertices
- K is used to enable Knife option and create manual cuts 
- Ctrl L link Materials can be used to share material between multiple objecs
