# Sculpting

## Sculpt Mode
- F can be used to change the radius
- In sculpting mode we can add more vertexes using Dyntopo for the sculpted part
- For Dyntopo the Relative Detailing changes face size depending on how closely zoomed in on your object and Constant Detailing applies the same size 
- Ctrl click will have the opposite affect of your brush
